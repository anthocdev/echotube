# EchoTube (Abandoned)
### React-Node/Express-MySQL 

A large project I used as a means to learn new technologies, it backfired quality-wise, but the learning curve was worth it.
Due to a variety of changes in YouTube and Google API policies I chose to move towards other projects, this one needs a lot of rework to perform and look well. 

## Quoting Write-Up
'YouTube playlist management web application that allows users to uniquely categorise their own proposed playlists and store the details separately from YouTube. Songs stored would also have more specific information attached if they are available from outside sources; these include Album, Genre, Artist, BPM and any other relevant data. The application would then allow users to listen to and share their playlists in an alternative environment where users may exchange reviews, ratings and get recommendations for playlists of similar nature. The primary issue which the project aims to deal with as shown in Fig.3 below is the loss of information regarding uploaded videos after they are deleted by the original author.
